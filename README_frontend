Frontend Analytics Dashboard 
===========================================

Overview
--------
This project is a React + Vite frontend that connects to the Event Analytics Backend
and displays event performance metrics in an interactive dashboard.

It provides a clean, responsive interface for viewing:
- RSVP and attendance statistics
- Visual charts and graphs
- Attendee feedback and ratings
- Department distribution analytics

Repository Contents
-------------------

  - App.jsx                 (Main application component)
  - main.jsx                (React entry point)
  - components/
    - EventSummary.jsx      (4 stat cards: RSVPs, Attendance, Rate, Rating)
    - AttendanceChart.jsx   (Bar chart comparing attendance metrics)
    - RatingChart.jsx       (Star rating display with percentage bar)
    - DepartmentChart.jsx   (Pie chart for department distribution)

Frontend Setup
--------------
Prerequisites:
- Node.js 
- Backend server running on port 3000

Steps:

1) Navigate to the frontend directory:

   cd Frontend

2) Install dependencies:

   npm install

3) Start the development server:

   npm run dev

4) Open your browser to:

   http://localhost:5173

The application will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

How It Works
------------
The frontend connects to the backend API endpoint:

  GET http://localhost:3000/api/events/:id/summary

Features:
- Real-time data fetching when event ID changes
- Interactive charts using Recharts library
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Error handling for failed API requests
- Loading states during data fetching

Key Components:
- Event ID selector to switch between different events
- Four colored stat cards showing key metrics
- Bar chart comparing RSVPs vs Actual vs Expected attendance
- Star rating display with visual percentage bar
- Pie chart showing department distribution
- Scrollable comments section with attendee feedback

Integration with Backend
------------------------
This frontend is designed to work with the Event Analytics Backend. Make sure:

1) The backend is running on http://localhost:3000
2) The backend API endpoint /api/events/:id/summary is accessible
3) CORS is enabled in the backend (which it is by default)

The frontend uses a proxy configuration to communicate with the backend during development.

Common Issues
-------------
1) "Failed to fetch event data" error
   - Ensure the backend server is running on port 3000
   - Check that the API endpoint returns data for the event ID

2) White screen or blank page
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify all component files exist in the components folder
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

3) Charts not displaying
   - Verify Recharts library is installed
   - Check that data is being passed correctly to chart components

4) Styling issues
   - Confirm App.css is properly linked
   - Check for CSS class name mismatches
